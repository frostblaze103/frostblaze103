- 👋 Hi, I’m @frostblaze103
- 👀 I’m interested in modifications to games, reading novels translated from other countries, playing games more oriented towards strategy even if its just brute forcing it, sleeping like a log and a lot of bios logos stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning biology at a post-graduate level as of making this.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data research on some genes that are potentially harmful or helpful, depending on context ofc.
- 📫 How to reach me, probably just send a comment. Haven't gotten on FB, Insta, tiktok for personal reasons.
